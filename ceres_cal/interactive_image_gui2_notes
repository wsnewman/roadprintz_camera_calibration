Run this node for precision GUI-based start/end point commands

Need to have images published on topic /camera/image_rect_color

for off-line debug/test, can use, e.g.:

cd ~/roadprintz_ws/stella_calib_data/stella_lidar_data
rosrun pcl_utils debug_publish_image_from_camera
 and respond to prompt w/ filename, e.g. image1.png

Note: for these images, also have intersection points saved in (u,v) pixel coords, 
  as well as (x,y)/sys_ref_frame metric coords (see *.csv files in this directory)

To use:
 *click a point on the wide view.
 *this will bring up a zoomed-in view in the "ZoomWindow"
  the border will be red for first point, and blue for second point
 *click a point in the zoomed view.  If red, this will establish point1 (presumably, start point)
   can keep re-clicking to alter the red/start point.

 *left-click in the wide view near a region of interest for 2nd point
  this will change the zoomed view

 *right-click in the zoomed view; this will change mode to point2 (end point).
  the zoomed view will now be framed in blue

 *click in the zoomed view to establish the second point;
   pt2 will show up in blue in both the zoomed view and the wide view
   the wide view will also show a green line connecting pt1 and pt2

 *iterate as desired until a line of interest is established
 *right-click in the wide view;
  this will publish a "Polygon" with 2 points (pt1, pt2) on topic: /polygon_wrt_sys_ref_frame

These metric coordinates should be confirmed vs known values

  To have robot execute path from pt1 to pt2 holding a laser pointing down, run the complementary node:

  rosrun test_moves test_laser_lines

There are currently breakpoints for approach, line, return to camera pose
