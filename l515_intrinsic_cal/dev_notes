example: x=2.05, y=0, z=1 shows poster at "bottom" of view


change tool angle from 180deg to 17 deg
  so add 2.84 rad to orientation command
REDO:
xmax = 2.2
xmin = 1.9
y_max = 0.2
y_min = 

recenter poster at (2,0,1)
xmax =2.15
xmin =1.85
ymax 0.23
ymin -0.23

FOR EXTRINSICS:
try: center on x,y = 2.0, 0
run z = 0.9 to 0.4 in steps of 0.1

small poster squares measurement:
45.2 cm (452mm), 9 squares -->1.977"
  try adding 0.5mm: 1.979"
 if assume sqr is 2.000"--> 50.8mm*9 = 457.2mm
--> 50.2mm width

short dim: 7 squares, 351mm --> 50.14mm square height


FOR LARGE POSTER: z-height of flange = 0.2 is pretty nice
