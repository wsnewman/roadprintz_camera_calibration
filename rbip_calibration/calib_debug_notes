laser-pointing debug

pt_on_RBIP_plane_wrt_RBIP seems good (get good pointing accuracy on floor)

height of laser appears OK--so patch-finding is likely OK

running on _bad_move scan and corresponding virtual image...

pt_on_poster_wrt_RBIP:  1.56614   1.4231 0.374445
test_pt_wrt_RBIP:       1.56607   1.42226   0.376

these look consistent
