using extrinsics:

1) means to get pixel data from image (use GUI?)
   need accurate conversion to rectified-image pixels

2) need plane fit: normal and offset
   need to construct a planar coord frame

3) use intrinsics to compute a ray from camera focal point through pixel (i,j)

3.5) convert ray to sys_ref_frame (need extrinsics here; extract camera-to-forearm from camera-to-sys_ref_frame)

4) find intersection of above ray w/ identified plane

5) convert this point to sys_ref_frame coords

6) send robot to this point (w/ laser)

7) test w/ checkerboard; get offset errors  (put grid on top of checkerboard?)

-----dev----
start w/ getting transform, T_cam/forearm (both DH frame and tf frame)
