wsn_gui:

rosrun roadprintz_camera_calibration interactive_image_gui

in interactive_image_gui, change value of rescale_factor to size image to screen

when a pixel is clicked, the values are displayed.

Can test w/ known fiducials, e.g.:
cd /roadprintz_ws/stella_calib_data/stella_lidar_data
rosrun pcl_utils debug_publish_image_from_camera
  (respond, e.g., image1.png)

this will publish a static image to image topic;
known fiducials are in file:
 image1_corners.csv

observed mouse clicks agree with list of key points (fiducials)...within placement error



next steps:

incorporate transform, (u,v)--> (x,y,z)/sys_ref_frame

then send the robot to this point:

(use new laser transform in place of tool transform)

do this like painting approach?  from home pose?  from camera pose?

incorporate traj utils in this GUI???

(have alt service or action-server available???)

would need IK to get joint-space soln
(define fixed height)

how to behave:  go to point, dwell, go back to camera pose???
