interpretation of image values:
start w/ image1

corner values, metric, for lidar:
as saved, these raster roughly along lines parallel to
  the sys_ref_frame y-axis
points are listed in increasing values of y,
advance to next line is increasing value of x
(in sys_ref_frame)

i.e., raster like NTSC from upper-left corner (in image)

BUT, there could be issues with translation to/from
 pcd/image

laser_pcd1.png appears w/ same orientation as camera image

processed_laser_pcd1.png is created by running:
rosrun roadprintz_camera_calibration find_poster
  and responding with filename: laser_pcd1

The raster scan of poster corners is identical to that of processed_image1.png
(scans horizontally starting from upper-left of image).

EXPECT:  image j values increase along horizontal lines, and i-values increase
for each new line;

BUT, in laser_pcd1_corners, I see i-values increasing with horizontal sweep!
(and j increases for each line)

first col of image1_corners.csv has values that go up to ~1600


metric values:
y-values increase along horizontal scans,
and x-values increase for each for successive scans

WHY ARE CORNER VALUES SWAPPED??
