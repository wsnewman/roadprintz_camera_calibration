perspective_transform notes:


In simu, if want to fake publish an image from disk, navigate to that directory
(e.g. ~/roadprintz_ws/stella_calib_data/stella_lidar_data)
 and run:

`rosrun pcl_utils debug_publish_image_from_camera`
 and respond to prompt with image name (e.g. image1.png)
 (this may require suppressing the simulated camera that publishes to this same topic)

modified above to publish to: 
std::string image_topic="/camera_pretransformed/image_rect_color";


image on this topic is transformed  to ideal viewpoint and displayed in OPEN_CV window
also, published this image on topic "/camera/image_rect_color"
viewable via rqt_image_view

takes about 6 sec to transform (very slow!)

NEXT:
  do some topic magic to get GUI to use the transformed image;
  then test angles and lengths with 1m rectangle;  Is this image corrected?

roslaunch roadprintz_launch stella_sim_no_camera.launch
rosrun roadprintz_camera_calibration perspective_transform
cd ~/roadprintz_ws/stella_calib_data/stella_lidar_data
rosrun pcl_utils debug_publish_image_from_camera
  (reply: image1.png)
start the HMI
rosrun ip_cam stella_cam_calib_data_service
(then reset HMI)

careful...had to:
rosnode kill /camera/image_proc
since looks like 2 processes are publishing to /camera/image_rect_color/compressed
(I think I removed this from stella_sim_no_camera.launch)

perspective transform looks like it may be working...
BUT, rectangle is coming out too small (about 9.4 squares, not 10 squares).
Have a scaling problem.  Re-examine kpix??

trying transformed_image1.png
1745,761
968,824  for corners 13 squares apart
--59.96 pixels per square
i.e. 600 pixels/meter
(expected 590)

changed virtual camera vertical height; this made NO difference
changed cam_calib_data_service to KPIX=604, and rectangle fits pretty well on checkerboard dimensions
  BUT, KPIX was set to 590 in perspective transform
STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE DISCREPANCY
error in camera transform??
