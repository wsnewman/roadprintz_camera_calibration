example images from new transforms;

run with:

either rosrun ip_cam stella_ipcam_driver3
OR
cd to an image directory and run:
rosrun ip_cam stella_fake_publish_camera_from_image 
  and choose to publish raw images
  and type in example raw image name in current directory

Run the custom rectifier with:

rosrun ip_cam stella_ipcam_rectifier 

this takes in raw images (pre-transformed) and performs rectification, similar to image_proc, but with 
wider output image (less cropping)
output is /camera_pretransformed/image_rect_color

Run the perspective transformer:

rosrun rbip_calibration perspective_transform_v3

this takes in rectified but pre-transformed images, performs perspective transformation, and publishes
the result to /camera/image_rect_color

The resulting image should be a virtual, top-down view with known pixels/meter at RBIP plane level

NEXT, want to transform this again to account for image height, then reproject as equivalent image on ground plane
(for accurate template alignment)
