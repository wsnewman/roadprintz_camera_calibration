calibration tests, 3/9/20:

0) mount Huawei camera and laser pointer.

Use existing checkerboard template (and measure the dimensions carefully)

could:
   roslaunch roadprintz_launch roadprintz_nopainthead.launch
BUT, move tester should work w/ GUI startup launch as-is, so use GUI


1: set up target; use robot and laser to align

 command robot/laser to 1 point, then second point; using: 

  roslaunch mh5020_planner mh5020_cart_move_as.launch simu:=false

  rosrun cartesian_move_tester cartesian_move_flange_tester2

and enter desired values (flange height is hard-coded at 0.25, line 153)

prompts for x and y and executes Cartesian moves

Iterate on 2 locations w/ laser until have target well aligned

RECORD the chosen values AS WELL AS target dimensions; 
 also document w/ photo

target is aligned at x=2.5 --> 2nd row of squares closest to bumper
laser at x = 3.6875; y=0 --> furthest corner of square furthest from bumper



2) command rotations and take snapshots

*move to camera pose
rosrun ip_cam ipcam_driver
rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view

to jog joints, run:

rosrun test_jog_joints test_jog_joints
respond to prompts

jog a joint, then take a snapshot:

for snapshots, run:
rosservice call ipcam_snapshot 0

snapshots will be saved to: roadprintz_ws/ipcam_snapshots/xxxdatexxx.jpg  (timestamped snapshot)

use the above for each image, and take notes on angle sequences

target dimensions: 46.75" for 12 squares--> 98.9mm/square

start w/ x = 2.5, y=0;
goto x = 3.6875; y=0

camera mount: on tapped holes 3'0" from tapped holes nearer elbow;
  camera is roughly centered w/rt forearm radius;
  

start w/ x = 2.5, y=0;
goto x = 3.6875; y=0
in image, went from y (pixels) = y_start+dy; to y_start+13*dy;
w/  y_start=200; y_end = 368; dy = (y_end-y_start)/12.0 = 14
in truck frame, this is y=0, x = 2.50m

   y_laser_start = y_start+dy = 200+14 = 214;
   y_laser_end = vertex1.y = y_start+13*dy; = 200+13*14 = 382
 delta-y = 382-214 = 168
 in truck frame, 2nd laser point: x = 3.6875, y=0
  dx_truck = 1.1875m
  dy_pixels = 168 pixels
--> 168/1.1875m = 141.5 pixels/m, or 7.07mm/pixel
REDO for image 16 w/ rescaling

---------
point closest to bumper: i=307+3*16= 355
                         j=432+16 = 448  (355,448) 

2nd point, furthest from bumper: i = 355, 
                                 j = 241+16= 257  (355,257)
delta_j = 448-257 = 191 pixels;
corresponds to robot dx = 1.187m
--> 6.2mm/pixel
